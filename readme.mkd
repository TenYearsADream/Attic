# Attic

This is a repository for my projects that are too small and insignificant to
deserve their own git repository (yet).

## License

All content is released under the GNU General Public License, version 3.0 or
later.  I can probably be convinced to release items under a different license
for a good cause (e.g. to allow integration into an existing BSD licensed
project).
